## Introduction
This is a payment gateway for [Roblox](https://roblox.com) which takes their in-game currency as a payment method for your executables/software or services.
I have been meaning to make something like this for a while and figured why not create this for my LB2 so I can also be able to use it for my own project.

## Requirements
- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Roblox](https://roblox.com) account (for the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie which has to be placed in the buxpay > main.json file)

### Python libraries
```
flask 
uuid
threading
datetime
beautifulsoup
```

## Explanation
I wanted to create a service with API keys that I can sell to others so they can use my service to sell their own executables/software or services.
I have created a simple API key system which is stored in the buxpay > main.json file.
This code works as I have tested it and made some sales with it.
